    "   - Definition: Syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that violates the\n",

    "   - Cause: Syntax errors result from typos, missing colons, incorrect indentation, or other violations\n",

    "2. Exceptions:\n",
    "   - Definition: Exceptions are runtime errors that occur during program execution. Unlike syntax errors,\n",
    "                 exceptions allow the program to run but may cause it to terminate unexpectedly.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's why we need custom exceptions and an example to illustrate their usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why Custom Exceptions?\n",
    "   - Specificity: Built-in exceptions cover common cases, but custom exceptions allow us to address unique \n",
    "                      scenarios specific to our project.\n",
    "   - Clarity: Custom exceptions clearly communicate what went wrong and why to users.\n",
    "   - Modularity: Placing user-defined exceptions in separate files enhances code organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Defining Custom Exceptions:\n",
    "   - To create a custom exception, we define a new class that inherits from the built-in 'Exception' class.\n",
    "   - Syntax: class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "                    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example: Invalid Age Exception:\n",
    "   Let's create a custom exception called 'InvalidAgeException'. This exception will be raised when the user enters\n",
    "   an age less than 18 (indicating ineligibility to vote).\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class InvalidAgeException(Exception):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Raised when the input value is less than 18\"\"\"\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    number = 18\n",
    "    input_num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    if input_num < number:\n",
    "        raise InvalidAgeException\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Eligible to Vote\")\n",
    "except InvalidAgeException:\n",
    "     print(\"Exception occurred: Invalid Age\")\n",

    "     Enter a number: 45\n",
    "     Eligible to Vote\n",
    "   - If the user input 'input_num' is smaller than 18:\n",
    "     Enter a number: 14\n",

    "\n",
    "   In this example, we've defined the custom exception 'InvalidAgeException' by creating a new class\n",

    "   is skipped, and the 'except' block catches the user-defined exception.\n",

    "   - We can further customize our custom exception class to accept additional arguments as needed.\n",
